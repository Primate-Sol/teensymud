= TeensyMUD Server
= v2.0.2

---
== Introduction
TeensyMUD is a very simple mud server written in Ruby.  It uses a one thread per connection network model and YAML formatted text files as a database.

This server was initially created in response to an Aprils Fool's joke posted by Erwin Andreasen on TheMudConnector forum announcing a 1K mud contest.  Those obfuscated versions can be found in the repository.

Does TeensyMUD have a future?  Who knows?  I don't.
